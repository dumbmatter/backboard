db.on('quotaexceeded', cb) tests
  how? the tricky part is how to test propagation from a request

should i also have db.on for blocked?

is upgradeDB hooked up to abort handler (and therefore quotaexceeded) by default? if not, how?

what promise library (if any) should be shipped by default?

for bbgm
  need to show user message on quota error. MAKE FUCKING SURE THIS WORKS. i don't want to accidentally cancle propagation of that

better documentation
  iterate arg order
  similar to
    https://github.com/jakearchibald/indexeddb-promised but a bit more idiosyncratic
    dexie
  but slightly nicer API, pluggable promise library, error handling
  feature detection in root.js - abstract into lib function, put in documentation
  limitations
    getKey, openKeyCursor
    some cursor functionality missing
  Full API in a separate file
  npm install

eslint indent won't work because it can't handle double indented function in argument to function that returns promise

firefox hack in 'error propagation' tests in test/transaction.js
