  can use Backboard API inside it?
    README

db.on('quotaexceeded', cb) tests
  how? the tricky part is how to test propagation from a request

more concise schema definition, maybe use version as key of object and then the object stores are the value. only tricky part would be that you need to sort the keys before iterating over the schemas and you have to parse the string into a number

what promise library (if any) should be shipped by default?

for bbgm
  need to show user message on quota error. MAKE FUCKING SURE THIS WORKS. i don't want to accidentally cancle propagation of that

better documentation
  iterate arg order
  similar to
    https://github.com/jakearchibald/indexeddb-promised but a bit more idiosyncratic
    dexie
  but slightly nicer API, pluggable promise library, error handling
  feature detection in root.js - abstract into lib function, put in documentation
  limitations
  error handling (ideally.. confirm with test)
    transaction promise rejects on abort. actual errors should be handled at request level
    db versionchange and quotaexceeded only. you probably do really want to listen to these. versionchange to close, quotaexceeded to do... something
  Full API
  npm install

eslint indent won't work because it can't handle double indented function in argument to function that returns promise

firefox hack in 'error propagation' tests in test/transaction.js
