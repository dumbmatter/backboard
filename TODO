event listeners, do they matter?
  DB.onversionchange

Should *.onabort be an error, or what? how do other libraries handle it?

Index.openKeyCursor

Index.getKey

other properties on cursor
  Cursor.source
  Cursor.direction
  Cursor.key
  Cursor.primaryKey
  Cursor.update()
  Cursor.advance()
  Cursor.continue()
  Cursor.delete()
  Cursor.value

add getAll to fakeIndexedDB, then use here
  why not use shim?

more concise schema definition, maybe use version as key of object and then the object stores are the value. only tricky part would be that you need to sort the keys before iterating over the schemas and you have to parse the string into a number

all those _wrapRequest calls (and definition) in DB.js and keyrange calls in index.js, not very DRY

what promise library (if any) should be shipped by default?

better way of passing Backboard around to stuff in lib

better documentation
  iterate arg order
  similar to
    https://github.com/jakearchibald/indexeddb-promised
    dexie
  but slightly nicer API, pluggable promise library
  feature detection in root.js - abstract into lib function, put in documentation
