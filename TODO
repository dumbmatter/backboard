iterate

add getAll to fakeIndexedDB, then use here

more concise schema definition, maybe use version as key of object and then the object stores are the value. only tricky part would be that you need to sort the keys before iterating over the schemas

all those _wrapRequest calls in DB.js, not very DRY

test in browsers, particularly the promise race condition stuff
