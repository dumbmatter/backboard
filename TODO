event listeners
  allow listening to transaction and db errors, because those could come back after promise resolves
    db.onabort
    db.onerror
    db.onversionchange
    tx.onerror
    tx.onabort
  for bbgm, need to be able to listen to abort events to show user message on quota error
  for tx.onerror and tx.onabort, could just reject complete promise
    better syntax might have db.tx('players', (tx) { use tx; }).then/catch, and have abort and error both reject
  allow bubbling of errors and allow listening to db.onabort, db.onerror, and db.onversionchange somehow
    currently disabled bubbling in some places
    default error handlers?
  inside tx don't need to return promise chain, but you should for error handling
    but if we re-enabled bubbling there, it would be fine, right?
    should ideally be so that if it's explicitly caught at get/put/add, it shouldn't bubble to transaction, and if it's caught at transaction it shouldn't bubble to db. is that possible?

Better tests for transaction abort/error, and bubbling to db abort event

Index.openKeyCursor? maybe skip

Index.getKey

get rid of iterate advance feature. if anyone needs more cursor functions, should implement a more direct translation of cursor API like indexeddb-promised

add getAll to fakeIndexedDB, then use here
  why not use shim?

more concise schema definition, maybe use version as key of object and then the object stores are the value. only tricky part would be that you need to sort the keys before iterating over the schemas and you have to parse the string into a number

all those _wrapRequest calls (and definition) in DB.js and keyrange calls in index.js, not very DRY

what promise library (if any) should be shipped by default?

better way of passing Backboard around to stuff in lib

better documentation
  iterate arg order
  similar to
    https://github.com/jakearchibald/indexeddb-promised but a bit more idiosyncratic
    dexie
  but slightly nicer API, pluggable promise library, error handling
  feature detection in root.js - abstract into lib function, put in documentation

eslint indent won't work because it can't handle double indented function in argument to function that returns promise
